# dataquest-projects
Here are some of the projects I worked with while taking the Dataquest's certification called: __Data Scientist in Python__.

After completing the certification, I further developed some of them to make them more interesting.

1. **Credit Modeling (Lending Club)**
    * _Objective_: Build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not

2. **Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In**
    * _Objective_: Find the best two markets (countries) to advertise our product in

3. **Analyzing NYC High School Data**
    * _Objectives_:
        * Investigate possible relationships (correlations) between SAT scores and demographic factors (e.g. race, gender)
        * Find out if the AP exam information is correlated with the SAT scores across high schools
        * Parse the latitude and longitude coordinates for each school. This will enable us to map the schools and uncover any geographic patterns in the data
